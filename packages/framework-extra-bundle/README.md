# Draw Framework Extra Bundle

This bundle is used to integrate draw/* component in Symfony.

Everything is configurable via the **draw_framework_extra** namespace.

Some sections are enabled by default if the corresponding draw component is available.

Other will need you to enabled them manually base on the fact they need configuration, or they will
create useless side effect (load, database structure, etc.) if they are not needed.
